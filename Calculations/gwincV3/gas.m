function n = gas(f, ifo)
% The following function models the noise spectrum caused by the passage of
% residual gas molecules through the laser beams in the arms of the  
% interferometer.  The method used here is presented by Rainer Weiss,
% Micheal E. Zucker, and Stanley E. Whitcomb in their paper Optical
% Pathlength Noise in Sensitive Interferometers Due to Residual Gas.
