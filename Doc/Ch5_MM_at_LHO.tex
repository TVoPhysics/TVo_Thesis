	The importance of mode-matching actually goes beyond reducing the amount of losses in coupled cavities.  It also is important for cavity stability.  If we look at the g-factor of a cavity, it is required through ABCD transformations that the values lay between 0 and 1.  For the signal recycling cavity, if the round trip gouy phase is off by a few millimeters, the stability of the cavity can be compromised.
