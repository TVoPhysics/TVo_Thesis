	\chapter*{Abstract}
	The era of gravitational waves astronomy was ushered in by the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) collaboration with the detection of a binary black hole collision \cite{DetectionPaper}.  The event that shook the foundation of space-time allowed mankind to view the cosmos in a way that had never been done previously. Since then, another remarkable event was found by the LIGO and Virgo detectors where two neutron stars collided sending both gravitational and electromagnetic waves to earth \cite{BNS}. LIGO was built with the purpose of detecting the ripples in space-time caused by astrophysical events with the hopes of understanding the complexities hidden within the cosmos.  In 2011, the primary stages of Advanced LIGO were installed and commissioned to start the first observing run (O1).  During the writing of this thesis, the detectors had hardware replaced in order to mitigate noise from scattered light and new optics which reduced the losses from absorption.  The upgrades were in preparation for the third observing run (O3) and the work presented here is primarily focused on experimental techniques for operating at higher power and mode matching Gaussian beams in the dual-recycled Michelson interferometer for the Advanced LIGO era and beyond.  The first two chapters discuss the fundamentals of gravitational waves and the LIGO detector configurations.  The third chapter introduces the reader to fundamentals in mode matching Gaussian laser beams.  The fourth and fifth chapter summarizes the author's work at Syracuse University and LIGO Hanford observatory in mode sensing and high-powered commissioning.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my thesis advisor Stefan Ballmer for trusting in me as a scientist, always being there for indispensable advice to push forward, and letting me work on whatever I found interesting and useful.

To Peter Saulson, your stories, love of science, and intuition truly inspires me to be a better scientist and teacher.

To Duncan Brown, being asked questions at the board during group meetings always made me sweat a little but it also made me a better physicist.

To Sheila Dwyer, Jenne Driggers, and Georgia Mansell: thank you for your patience in teaching me the gritty details about the Hanford interferometer, I will never forget the difficult in-chamber work on HAM6 and the long commissioning hours in the control room.

To Daniel Sigg, the dinners were always amazing and thank you for letting me participate in some of the crucial interferometer tasks.

To Keita Kawabe, thank you for the tough questions but also the encouragement to do the best science possible.

To Rick Savage, the Fellows program is one of the best parts of being at Hanford and I was honored to be a part of it for so long, thank you for the advice about all aspects of life and the fishing trips just when I needed it most.

To Aidan

To Daniel Vander-Hyde, thank you for helping at Hanford with your extra hands/brain and being patient with me when things weren't going well but also celebrating when things were!

To Dan Brown,

To Corey Gray, Gunner and Gomez:

To all the operators and staff at Hanford: Jeff, Betsy, Chandra, TJ, Jim, Cheryl, Nico, Patrick, Ed, Gerardo, Evan.

To Hang Yu, thank you for helping me understand the inner workings of the interferometer with only a few lines of math and a picture.

To all the fellows and visitors who contributed to making my time at Hanford so enjoyable.

To all of my former teachers Melissa Brainerd, Paul Didier, Chrissy Dahms, Carolyn West, and Dan Dorsey:  The accumulated effect of my work is a direct result of your teachings, thank you for inspiring kids like me in White Center to chase our dreams.

To my childhood friends Quang, Leah, Thang, Sienna, Khanh, Truc, Kay, Tuan, Wanda, James, Matt and Trung:  I've been gone a long time to pursue this work but I know there is always support back home.

To the Bloomingdale family: Thank you for always making me feel at home even in the coldest of Syracuse winters.

To Jaysin Lord, Laura Nuttall, and Mat Hutchens: Thank you for the laughs and Thursday wings.

To my family Cuong, Nhi, Tony, Theresa, Brittny, Kayla, Chloe: Thank you for always supporting in pursuing my dreams

To my parents: I know it was difficult leaving Vietnam to come here, this work is dedicated to you.

To my darling Tiffany: Your support provides nourishment for my soul and your love gives a guiding light through the darkest of nights.
