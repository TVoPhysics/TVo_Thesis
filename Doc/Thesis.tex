	The era of gravitational waves astronomy was ushered in by the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) collaboration with the detection of a binary black hole collision (Detection paper).  The event that shook the foundation of space-time allowed mankind to view the cosmos in a way that had never been done previously.
