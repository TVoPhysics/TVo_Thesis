	\section{A Global Active Wavefront Control Scheme}
	To truly implement a system that solves the mode matching challenges presented in LIGO, an active control scheme that implements both sensors and actuators will be required to span the degrees of freedom that are present in the interferometer.
	
	\subsection{Hard and Soft Mode Matching}
	Similar to the wavefront sensors already being used in LIGO at the time of this writing, the active wavefront system should be able to rotate the phase of their actuators and sensors to the common and differential basis.  Also, the extra two degrees of freedom required are the hard and soft modes for thermal lensing which curve the ITMs and ETMs in a way which vary the waist size and position orthogonally.
