\chapter{Solutions for Detector Upgrades} 
A solution to the current mode matching situation will be solved by further expanding active wavefront control described in Section \cite{AWC_current}. A full modal picture, sensors and actuator
	\section{Sensors}
* Bullseye photodetectors

* Operation: range (in terms of watts and percentage mismatch)


	\section{High Sensitivity Telescope}
	* Translation stages: General principles, rigging, sensitivity
	
	* Mechanical description (Solidworks designs)
	
	* Constraints (range, vacuum, alignment, integration)

	* Electronics 
	
	* Software
	
	*Implementation: rigg something better, in situ measurements.
