\chapter{Simulating Mode-Matching with Finesse}
As with most simple concepts Within LIGO, the complexity scales very rapidly in application to the main interferometer and mode matching is no exception so it is useful to use a full scale simulation to extract as much information as possible.

Mode matching a linear cavity which has a single waist size and location relative to the input beam equates to two degrees of freedom.  There is an arbitrary method where one could match the optical cavity with the input beam using heaters on the test mass or one could have deformable lenses which shape the incoming beam; this picture works for cavities which feed one Gaussian mode into the another such as the input (or output) mode cleaner.
