		The horizontal axis is differential lensing between the ITMX/ITMY substrates and the vertical axis represents the normalized power when locked with nominal mode matching.  POP-18 is the signal at the power recycling pick-off port demodulated at 18 MHz which shows the sideband power buildup in the power recycling cavity. In this particular simulation the differential lensing requires finding a new operational point to lock the longitudinal degrees of freedom.  Additionally, the sensors which are used to maintain resonance and readout the RF power need to be re-phased in order to get the upper limit estimate.  Even with modest differential lensing (10 microdiopters), the buildup drops by 20 percent and eventually the simulation has trouble maintaining resonance similarly to the actual interferometer.

	{\textbf{Interferometer DC powers as a function of round trip arm loss and test mass absorption.}
	Simplifying the power recycling cavity and a combined arm model to understand the powers as a function of loss has a few advantages with regards to computational time and the results are easier to conceptually understand.  Here, absorption changes the radius of curvature and substrate thermal lens which results in some mode mismatch while the round trip loss takes into account the rest of the higher order modes from point absorbers.  The ITM absorption has a much larger effect on the overall power recycling gain loss by almost a factor of 3 compared to ETM absorption.  Of course, the simplified model will fall short in describing effects on the antisymmetric signals of the full interferometer.

	Injecting a dither line into each degree of freedom then digitally demodulating the respective sensors at the excitation frequency can quantify how much the optical gain shifts as a function of heating. At time t=0, the power begins increasing from 2 watts of input power to 20 watts. In PRCL, there is a drop to about 80\% of the starting magnitude and about 7.5 degrees of phase rotation with the first power increase. At 0.9 hours, the input power goes from 20 to 30 watts and the magnitude drops to about 30\% of the original gain which results in a lock loss.  As for the SRCL and MICH degrees of freedom, there is a slight change at the beginning but not nearly as bad as PRCL.

The right plot shows the Hartmann sensor spherical power as a function of time with the starting point scaled to zero micro-diopters.  Although the point absorbers do not exhibit the same spatial structure as uniform heating so it is difficult to derive absolute absorption for ITMY, the spherical fitting gives some information about the relative scale of heating absorption between the two optics.}

	Compared to the ITMX phase map in Figure \ref{fig:ITMX_HWS_plot}, ITMY has a much larger overall heating pattern and higher spatial frequencies in the contours which was the first clue that revealed multiple (possibly 4) point absorber on the test mass.  There is also a halo of gradients on the outer rim of the plots which is most prominent on the lower left corner.  This is due reducing the CO2 laser power in an attempt to compensate the lensing effects as the interferometer beam heats up the test mass.  The overall scale of self-heating with the higher spatial frequencies of the point absorbers makes it incredibly difficult to compensate with using the CO2 lasers as designed by Advanced LIGO. }

		The horizontal axes represent the test mass coordinates as seen on the Hartmann sensors and the vertical axis is the optical path distortion in units of nanometers. The color map is scaled for each plot and is meant to show particularly hot areas and roughly compare the high frequency spatial distribution of point absorbers. Plots in the left column (ITMX) have smooth spatial features that stem from uniform absorption and the effects are not prominent till after approximately 500 seconds.  In contrast, plots in the right column (ITMY) have very sharp spatial features which already rise above the floor at 200 seconds into powering up.  Comparing the overall surface deformation on the same scale, the difference between ITMX and ITMY is striking and it is clear how an interferometer with point absorbers on the surface will struggle to increase powers above 200 kW within the arm cavities.
